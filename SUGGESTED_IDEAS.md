## Suggested Ideas for WebApp Enhancements

### I. Data Input & Processing:
1.  **Delimiter Selection/Confirmation:** Add UI for explicit delimiter selection (comma, semicolon, tab) to improve robustness.
2.  **AI-Powered Data Cleaning and Transformation Suggestions:** Analyze data for issues (missing values, inconsistent types, outliers) and leverage AI to suggest and potentially apply cleaning/transformation methods.
3.  **Support for Other Data Formats:** Extend parsing to JSON or Excel files.

### II. Charting & Visualization:
1.  **More Chart Types:** Add scatter plots, heatmaps, and stacked bar/area charts.
2.  **Interactive Chart Customization:** Allow users to easily change axis labels, font sizes, grid lines, and add annotations.
3.  **Multiple Chart Views/Dashboards:** Enable creation and arrangement of multiple charts from the same dataset.

### III. AI Insights & Storytelling:
1.  **More Granular AI Prompts/Guidance:** Allow AI to ask more specific questions based on data for deeper narratives.
2.  **AI-Driven Data Transformation Suggestions:** AI could suggest data transformations based on user goals.
3.  **Narrative Export Formats:** Allow export to PDF, Markdown, or HTML.
4.  **AI Persona/Tone Selection:** Let users choose an AI persona (e.g., "Formal Analyst") to influence narrative style.

### IV. User Experience & Interface:
1.  **Drag-and-Drop File Upload:** Implement drag-and-drop for file input.
2.  **Loading Indicators & Progress Bars:** Provide more detailed feedback for long processing times.
3.  **Responsive Design Refinements:** Further optimize for various screen sizes.
4.  **"Save Project" Functionality:** Allow saving and reloading entire sessions.
